    "**Distribute Load Across Servers**: Deploy more instances of your monolith behind a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers.",
    "**Auto-Scaling Groups**: Implement auto-scaling groups that automatically adjust the number of running instances based on current demand (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling).",
    "**Read Replicas**: If your application reads more than it writes, add read replicas to offload read traffic from the primary database."
