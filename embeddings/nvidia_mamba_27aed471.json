    "**Issue**: Rendering large datasets causes UI freezes.",
    "**Why it matters**: Rendering a huge list of items can significantly impact performance by causing the browser to struggle with layout calculations, style recalculations, and re-renders of components. This can lead to jank, lag, and even freezing of the application.",
    "**Solution**: Implement virtualization or pagination for large lists.",
    "**How it helps**: Virtualization (using libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`) renders only a subset of items visible on the screen at any given time. This drastically reduces the number of DOM nodes created and updated, leading to better performance and smoother user experience.",
    "**Why not just use `key` prop**: While using unique keys is crucial for React's reconciliation process, it doesn't address the root issue of rendering a massive list of items simultaneously, which causes the UI freeze."
