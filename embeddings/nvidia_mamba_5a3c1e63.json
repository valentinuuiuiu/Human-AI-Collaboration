    "*Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling:**",
    "**Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):** Increase the resources of your current server (e.g., CPU cores, RAM). While this can provide immediate performance improvements for read-heavy workloads or during traffic spikes, it has limitations and may not be sustainable in the long term.",
    "**Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):** Add more servers to distribute the load. This approach is generally more scalable but requires a robust infrastructure management strategy.",
    "*Cloud Providers:**",
    "*Sharding:** Split your database into smaller, more manageable pieces. This reduces the load on each shard and allows data to be distributed across multiple servers."
